## 1. What is Finda

Finda is an artificial intelligence. Our first generation reasoning model and our first artificial intelligence model is v1t.

### How was the v1t version name found

v1t version stands for Version 1 Thinking. The "Version 1" section here indicates that this is the first version of the AI ​​model.
"Thinking" suggests that this AI model is very good at thinking.

## 2. Base
Finda is not an AI rewritten from scratch. Finda uses the DeepSeek R1 platform. This allows the first version, v1t, to think and
respond very well. However, this doesn't mean AI will always give the correct answer. DeepSeek R1 has a hallucination rate as high
as its hallucination rate.
